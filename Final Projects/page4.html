    <p>Five years after the end of the Dragon Ball Z anime, Goku is accidentally turned back into a child by the Black Star Dragon Balls used by his old enemy Emperor Pilaf and is forced to travel across the universe to retrieve them along with his granddaughter Pan and Trunks. The trio go through various adventures in their journey to find the Black Star Dragon Balls, until they encounter the artificial Tuffle parasite, Baby, who intends to destroy the Saiyan race as his revenge for their extermination of the Tuffles many years ago.Baby has the ability to invade other people's bodies and turn them into Tuffles, as well as using a host's body to combine its power with his own and become a powerful warrior. After turning practically all of the Earth's population, including the Saiyans, into Tuffles, Baby decides to remain inside Vegeta's body and use it to kill Goku. Goku fights him and is quickly defeated, but, after having his tail regenerated by Kibito Kai and Old Kai, transforms and achieves the power of Super Saiyan 4. In this new form, Goku easily overpowers Baby before destroying the evil Tuffle by propelling him into the sun with a 10x Kamehameha.Piccolo then sacrifices himself to permanently destroy the Black Star Dragon Balls when the Earth explodes after Goku and the others help the people of Earth evacuate to Planet Plant, which Baby had wished back into existence using the Black Star Dragon Balls.</p>
