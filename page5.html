    <p>After Majin Buu was defeated and Earth at peace, the heroes have settled into normal lives, which in Goku's case means being a radish farmer. They can't get too comfortable in their new lives because more evildoers are on the horizon. Enter Beerus, the powerful god of destruction, who awakens -- far away from Earth to a prophecy predicting his demise at the hands of an even more formidable being. His search for that being brings him to Earth, where he enters a battle against Goku and his friends. In order to save the world -- again -- they must defeat Beerus, their strongest opponent yet.
      While Goku and Vegeta leave with Beerus and Whis to train for a year, the remaining remnants of Frieza's army arrive on Earth in search for the Dragon Balls to revive Frieza. A few months after coming back to life and training, Frieza gathers his forces and returns to enact his revenge on Goku. Despite achieving a new transformation called Golden Frieza, he is defeated by Goku and Vegeta, who have both mastered the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan transformation. Frieza blows up the Earth in retaliation. However, with Whis's ability to manipulate time, Goku destroyed Frieza once again.</p>

  <p>Champa, Beerus' brother and the God of Destruction of Universe Six, convinces Beerus to hold a tournament between the best fighters from their universes. Whis reveals that there are twelve universes in existence. The universe that Goku and his friends are from is called Universe Seven. Champa also reveals the reward for their tournament will be the Super Dragon Balls, which are planet-sized Dragon Balls whose wish-granting abilities are practically limitless. Champa intends to swap Universe Six's destroyed Earth with Universe Seven's for their cuisine. Goku and his friends join the tournament. Each match in the tournament shows different surprises and abilities. The tournament reaches its climax in the second-to-last match between Goku and Hit. After a failed attempt to lift the rules to face Hit in his full power, Goku forfeits the match. However, Hit forfeits the final match since he was inspired by Goku to do the same thing. The tournament concludes with Universe Seven's victory. Beerus secretly wishes for the Super Dragon Balls to restore Universe Six's Earth.</p>
